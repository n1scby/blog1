    <h2>I Quit!</h2>
    <p>If anyone has ever wondered, "Should I quit my job?", then I understand.  I wanted to quit for many years but I just wasn't ready.  There 
        are many reasons people stay on. Mine were: <ul>
        <li>15 minute commute!</li>
        <li>5 weeks of vacation!</li>
        <li>Paycheck!</li>
        <li>Sense of security</li>
        <li>It was comfortable.  I knew pretty much what to expect.</li>    
        </ul> 
        Unfortunately, I didn't like my job though.  I was doing something I had done for many years and I wanted to expand my horizons.  Learn something new.  Something challenging.  Something exciting.
        So, that lead me to my decision. I needed to quit.  
    </p>
    <p>But how could I do it?  I didn't have enough skills in something else to get a job.  Heck, even my company only wanted me for one job.  What to do?
        I started looking for classes to take, but couldn't really find anything.  Nothing seemed to fit what I wanted.  Then I received an email 
        for a user group I had signed up for.  At the very bottom of the email was a note saying new classes were starting for a coding bootcamp.  What?  Really?  That's what I want to do!  
    </p>
    <p>But, at the time things seemed to be improving a little at work.  Maybe I should just hang on and give it a chance.  Maybe things will work out. I had a big project which I worked hard on and 
        did an excellent job on.  Then the next project came.  And I was back to where I was before.  I didn't want to be doing what I was doing.  I needed out.
    </p>
    <p>So, I did it.  I quit.  It was terrifying.  Saying to my boss that I was leaving was one of the harder things I had to do.  I was 
        worried that everyone would be angry with me.  But they weren't.  They were so supportive and excited about me going to school.  What a relief! 
    </p>
    <p>Now I am in class writing a blog post for an assignment.  I am on the path to finally doing what I want to do.  Yay!</p>
